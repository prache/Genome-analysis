# Diptera genome analysis

I am curious to investigate about Flesh flies immunity. Being a Diptera having such a filthy lifestyle, how could they simply survive?! and this is my basic question. I am always fascinated with their behaviour. They are attracted by dead animals, fecal matter, wounds from animals and humans, deadly smelly pitcher plants, and all kinds of decaying material including manure! They are the major vectors of bacteria and also "viruses". Despite of being carriers of such a deadly organisms they are surviving and reproducing on such matters.

What is the secret of their immunity? The answers are perhaps hidden in theie genome. Data mining to gather information from all publicly available dipteran genomes, and from additional genomes sequenced and assembled in our laboratory. I also have recieved genomes of Sarcophagidae from diptera specialists and genomes from the other diptera which are equally or less filthy. Only comparing genome does not provide any answer for the question. The hypothesis is whether the habitat rich in bacteria may lead to selection for increased diversity of immune components!

Well studied defensin gene in insects is responisble for their immunity. Comparing this gene among all the 59 different species of diptera including Sarcophagidae will generate results.

Hence I chose to use one of the popular linear models, Hidden Markov model (HMM). Created a bioinformatics pipeline in python. HMM uses the defencin gene template and searches the hits in massive set of genomes. Accordingly it provides the R values to infer the results to understand how far is the distance of these genes withing species of diptera. Also, using these results, I generate phylogenetic trees to understand the evolution of these genes.
